# convectioncppcuda

I originally wrote these codes as part of assignment to (successfully) qualify for my PhD in computational hydraulics at the University of Sheffield.

These codes are C++ and CUDA adaptations of Lorena Barba's '12 steps to CFD in Python'.

To be able to use CUDA you need a CUDA compatible graphics card, check here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

To compile the CUDA files you need the CUDA Toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
